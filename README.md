## Building EventBooking App from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components.
### This application (a EventBooking App) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Redux )  & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: EventListing , EventBooking  . mongodb handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by  Heruku as well.

### The styling is all handled via styled components. Using compound components made my actual dumb components really easy to test.
